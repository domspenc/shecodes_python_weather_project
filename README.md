# Plus Resources: Weather Project Template

Starter code for the Plus Weather project.

## TODO

- [x] Implement the methods in `weather.py`.
- [x] Verify that everything works as intended by running the tests with `python run_tests.py`.

### Some notes...
- The ```generate_summary``` function test does not pass when testing example two, because I noticed the minimum and maximum values had been swapped (unlike the rest of the examples in the test).</br> My code still works, as it finds the <em>true</em> minimum temperature (7.8°C), which does not match the test (8.3°C) - therefore it fails!
- I have not been able to get the ```generate_daily_summary``` tests to pass yet, however the code is running well and outputs something identical to what the test is looking for. Need to debug this at a later time.
- I have not yet added the pass button to my GitHub project dashboard... this I will try to add at a later time.
